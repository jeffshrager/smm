Counting vs Addition conflict analysis:
  2 -> ? = 3 (expected 3) conf:0.971
  2 + 2 = 3 (expected 4) conf:0.768 finger:False
    Conflict resolved: False (counting: True, addition: False)

  3 -> ? = 4 (expected 4) conf:0.966
  3 + 3 = 4 (expected 6) conf:0.999 finger:False
    Conflict resolved: False (counting: True, addition: False)

  4 -> ? = 5 (expected 5) conf:0.992
  4 + 4 = 5 (expected 8) conf:0.957 finger:False
    Conflict resolved: False (counting: True, addition: False)
