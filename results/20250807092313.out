--- Testing Model ---
1 -> ? = 8 (expected 2) ✗ conf:0.000 finger:True
3 -> ? = 3 (expected 4) ✗ conf:0.000 finger:True
5 -> ? = 2 (expected 6) ✗ conf:0.000 finger:True
2 -> 3 = 2 (expected 4) ✗ conf:0.000 finger:True
4 -> 5 = 8 (expected 6) ✗ conf:0.000 finger:True
1 + 2 = 3 (expected 3) ✓ conf:0.001 finger:True
2 + 2 = 4 (expected 4) ✓ conf:0.001 finger:True
